# Library Management System - Frontend-Backend Integration Complete

## Summary

I have successfully connected your frontend React application with the backend user-service API. The integration includes full user authentication, user management, and the first-time password change flow as requested.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. API Services Layer
- **`src/services/api.js`**: Base API service with JWT token handling
- **`src/services/authService.js`**: Authentication operations (login, validate, profile, password change)
- **`src/services/userService.js`**: User management operations (CRUD, activate/deactivate)

### 2. Authentication Flow
- ✅ Real login with backend API
- ✅ JWT token storage and management
- ✅ First-time password change flow
- ✅ Automatic logout on token expiration
- ✅ Role-based access control

### 3. User Management (Admin Only)
- ✅ Create student accounts with student ID and faculty
- ✅ Create librarian accounts with employee ID and department
- ✅ Create admin accounts with employee ID
- ✅ View all users with real-time data
- ✅ Activate/deactivate users
- ✅ Email notifications (handled by backend)

### 4. New Components
- **FirstTimePasswordChange**: Handles mandatory password change for new users
- **CreateUserModal**: Form for creating new user accounts (admin only)
- Updated **Users** page with real API integration
- Updated **AuthContext** to use real authentication

### 5. Updated Routing
- Password change redirect for new users
- Role-based route protection (ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, STUDENT)
- Proper authentication guards

## How It Works

### User Creation Flow (Admin)
1. Admin navigates to Users page
2. Clicks "Add New User" button
3. Fills out form based on role selection:
   - **Student**: Name, email, student ID, faculty
   - **Librarian**: Name, email, employee ID, department
   - **Admin**: Name, email, employee ID
4. Backend creates user with temporary password
5. Welcome email sent to user automatically
6. User list refreshes with new user

### First Login Flow
1. New user receives email with temporary credentials
2. User logs in with temporary password
3. System detects `mustChangePassword: true`
4. Automatically redirects to password change page
5. User must set new password before accessing system
6. After password change, user is logged out and must login again

### Regular Authentication
1. Users login with email/password
2. Backend validates and returns JWT token + user info
3. Token stored in localStorage
4. All API requests include Authorization header
5. Role-based routing and UI elements

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
Create `.env` file in frontend root:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8081
VITE_ENV=development
```

### Backend Requirements
Your user-service should be running on port 8081 with these endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/profile`
- `POST /api/auth/change-password-first-time`
- `GET /api/users`
- `POST /api/users/students`
- `POST /api/users/librarians`
- `POST /api/users/admins`
- `PATCH /api/users/{id}/activate`
- `PATCH /api/users/{id}/deactivate`

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Services
```bash
# Backend (user-service)
cd library-management-backend/user-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Frontend
cd library-management-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Admin Functions
1. Login as admin (use your backend seeded data)
2. Navigate to "User Management"
3. Click "Add New User"
4. Create a test student account
5. Verify email is sent (check backend logs)

### 3. Test First-Time Login
1. Use the temporary credentials for the new user
2. Login should redirect to password change page
3. Set new password
4. Should logout automatically
5. Login again with new password
